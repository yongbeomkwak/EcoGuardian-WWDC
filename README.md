## üåç About ‚ÄòEco Guardian
> ‚ÄòEco Guardian' is an educational app that tells  how to reduce carbon in the atmosphere.

<br><br>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Composition

My app consists of three main parts with distinct functionalities. 

The first part is the introduction screen, which showcases a moving giant carbon cloud and an endangered Earth.

The moving carbon cloud was created using SpriteKit's action feature, while the Earth and buttons were developed using SwiftUI.

The second part features a game story that addresses the current environmental crisis through a conversational approach using SwiftUI.

The third part is the actual game, which uses SpriteKit to teach players what actions to avoid and what actions to take in order to raise awareness and promote positive environmental actions.
